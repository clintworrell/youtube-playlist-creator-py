# Create YouTube Playlist from a URL 


## Project Idea
* Provide a URL containing YouTube videos
* Scrape the HTML for the video IDs
* Generate a YouTube playlist from the IDs

The playlist makes content consumption easier. When one video ends no need to exit full screen, find the next video, click play, and then re-enter full  screen.

		
## Project Goals
* Learn DevOps processes through deploying the app
* Brush up on Python skills through both building and deploying the app
* Build a web app that is useful for me
	* Provide a URL containing YouTube videos

		* Easier to consume. Don't have to scroll to find each video and play them individually.
